# LulzBot TAZ 6

## Quickstart
_AKA HOW DO I PRINT WITH THIS THING??_

1. Install [Cura](https://www.lulzbot.com/cura).

2. Load your `.stl` or `.obj` model file in Cura. You can find models from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).

3. Check which filament the machine is currently equipped with from the label of the filament roll. _Currently this is usually 2,85mm PLA._

4. Select matching _Material_ from the left hand side menu. For PLA you can use e.g. _Material ease of use: Beginner - Material: PLA (Village Plastics)_, which has basic
205 C° Printing temeprature and 60 C° Bed Temperature settings.

5. Make sure your model is laying flat on the ground on the 3D view. You probably shouldn't touch scaling or rotation, unless you know what you are doing.

6. Select your desired _quickprint profile_ from the left hand side menu. _Standard_ is probably good enough, unless you want to have a finer finish or faster print.

7. Determine if your piece needs supports to be printed. Pieces with overhangs often need support structures for the printing to succeed. Need of supports is also often specified in thingiverse description / comments. Enabled supports by ticking _Print support structure_.

8. If you piece needs extra support to not fall / stick better to the surface, you can also select _Print brim_. For smaller pieces this is likely not required, but go ahead.

9. Make sure the estimated print time & filament usage makes sense. 3D printing is quite slow by its nature. Please make sure that someone can stay at the office until the print is finished. __NOTE:__ The estimated time is often less than actual print time.

10. Export your print as `.gcode` file with some reasonable filename. Transfer this file on the printers removable SD card. If you are using a 2016 MacBook, ~~cry yourself to sleep and~~ try to find a card reader.

11. Pop the SD card back into the printer, turn it on and select "Print from SD card" using the pushable knob on the device. Find your file, and start printing.

12. After the print is done, the part will first be cooled down. After the desired cooling temperature is reached (45 C° for PLA), the printer will move back to neutral position and the part can be removed. The knife with blue handle and mild violence can be used to separate the piece from heat bed.
